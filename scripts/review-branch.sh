# Code review for one branch's pull request. The result goes to the PR as one
# comment and as the `review` commit status on HEAD, which scripts/land.sh
# requires before it merges.
#
# Picks a level from the committed diff against origin/main (fetched first;
# local main is never used, since nothing updates it any more): skip (no model), cheap
# (one sonnet pass) or full (four parallel reviewers, the deep one on fable, then one haiku
# confidence score per finding, findings under 75 dropped). Prints the
# findings and appends one line to <git-common-dir>/branch-reviews.log.
# Instruction files: docs/review/<pass>.md.
#
# At most two rounds per PR. The round state lives on the PR, not in local
# files, so a fresh checkout works the same: every comment this script posts
# starts with a marker line
#   <!-- agent-review round=<n> head=<sha> level=<level> high=<k> changes=<id> -->
# and the next run reads the PR's comments, highest round wins. <id> is the
# patch id of the branch's own non-Markdown changes against origin/main
# (`none` when there are none). A push that leaves it unchanged, such as
# merging main in or a docs-only commit, uses no round: the run re-posts that
# round's status on the new HEAD and exits with its result. Round 2
# reviews only what was committed since round 1's head (the fix for its HIGH
# findings) and never skips; a third run refuses. No PR yet means round 1
# against main. Only a HIGH finding fails the status; MEDIUM and LOW are
# posted and do not block.
#
# The reviewers run as subagents of the Claude session that owns the branch,
# because headless Claude CLI runs are refused on this account. The script hands
# work over through .review-pending/<key>/ in this worktree (git-ignored; a
# session's subagents may write there but not into the shared .git folder):
# a run writes one <pass>.prompt per pass and prints, per pass, its model,
# the prompt path and the .out path the session saves the reply to; the
# session runs those subagents, then runs --continue, which reads the replies
# and either prints the next set of passes (escalation, scoring) or records
# the result and deletes the pending directory.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/review-branch.sh [--continue]
#   (no flag)    start the next round; re-running before it finishes starts it over.
#   --continue   read the saved replies and go on to the next step.
# Exit: 0 reviewed, no HIGH finding; 1 a HIGH finding survived scoring (fix
#       groups printed in round 1), or two rounds are done;
#       2 the review did not run or its result could not be posted;
#       3 reviewer subagents needed (run the printed passes, then --continue).
# GH overrides the gh command (the self-test points it at a stub).

read -r -d '' OUTPUT_FORMAT <<'EOF'
Output format (a script parses this; follow it exactly):
- One line per finding: SEVERITY | path:line | one sentence naming the defect and the smallest fix.
- SEVERITY is exactly HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW.
  HIGH = a defect with a concrete failing scenario, a data-loss or lockout path, or a breach of a quoted AGENTS.md rule.
  MEDIUM = a likely defect without a confirmed scenario, or changed behaviour with no test where root AGENTS.md's Tests section says one is needed.
  LOW = readability or naming.
- If there are no findings, output the single line: NO FINDINGS
- Lines starting with anything else are shown to a human and never counted; add them only when your instructions above ask for them.
