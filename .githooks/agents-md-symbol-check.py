"""Warn when an AGENTS.md change names a code symbol the SAME COMMIT doesn't contain.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A commit that stages AGENTS.md edits without the code they describe puts docs
on main that name symbols present in no source file, and every agent that reads
them believes them. Root AGENTS.md carries the hard rule: docs never reach main
ahead of their code. This is the mechanical check behind it.

WHAT THIS COMPARES AGAINST — read before changing it
----------------------------------------------------
The oracle is THE COMMIT BEING CREATED (the staged index), and that choice is
load-bearing. The two obvious alternatives are both wrong:

  * Against `main`  — WRONG. Every worktree legitimately holding docs+code that
    hasn't merged yet would be told it's lying. That teaches agents the warning
    is noise, which is worse than having no check. Truth-in-an-unmerged-worktree
    is TRUE; this hook must never say otherwise.
  * Against the WORKING TREE — USELESS. It would pass a docs-only commit whose code
    is sitting right there unstaged at commit time.

Against the staged index, a docs-only commit fires (it staged no code, so the
symbols are absent from the tree it creates) and honest worktree work passes (it stages docs
and code together, so the symbols are present). That is exactly the line we want.

This NEVER blocks — it always exits 0. It is a nudge, not a gate. A false
positive costs one ignored line; a false negative costs a session.

    Two things this got wrong on the first pass, both found by backtesting
    against real history — do not "simplify" them back out:

    1. Search ALL tracked files, EXCLUDING *.md. Docs legitimately name things
       that live in scripts and config, not only in the main language. Excluding *.md is what keeps the check
       honest: a doc naming a symbol cannot be its own evidence.

    2. A match that is ONLY inside a comment does not count as existence.
       A wrong name written into both AGENTS.md and a doc comment would
       otherwise vouch for itself. Requiring one non-comment occurrence catches it.

    Substring (not word-boundary) match on purpose: lenient, so we only flag a
    symbol appearing nowhere real.
