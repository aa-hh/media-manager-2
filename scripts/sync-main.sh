# Keeps local main a fast-forward mirror of origin/main. Main takes changes
# only through pull requests, so nothing local ever needs to commit on
# it; this runs every 2 minutes from launchd
# (scripts/launchd/sync-main.plist.template, installed by scripts/setup.sh) so main follows a merge
# within minutes, with no session involved.
#
# Never merges, never discards anything: a dirty main checkout, or a local
# main holding commits origin lacks, is left alone with one line on stderr.
# Silent when there is nothing to do. Exits 0 except on a usage error, so a
# timer run never reports failure for an offline fetch.

# Usage: sh scripts/sync-main.sh
